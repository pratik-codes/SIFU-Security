### Protecting Smart Contracts with On-Chain and Off-Chain Security Solutions

[![Sifu Security Logo](https://sifusecurity.com/logo.png)](https://sifusecurity.com)

## üìú **Overview**

Sifu Security offers a comprehensive solution to protect decentralized applications (DApps), DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and cross-chain protocols from smart contract vulnerabilities and exploits. As the blockchain ecosystem continues to grow, securing smart contracts in real-time has become more critical than ever.

Our system integrates **on-chain** monitoring for real-time threat detection and **off-chain** auditing to ensure your contracts are secure, continuously compliant, and future-proofed against evolving risks.

---

## üöÄ **Why Sifu Security?**

- **Real-time protection**: Automatically detect and mitigate security threats as they happen on-chain.
- **Comprehensive audits**: Deep, off-chain smart contract audits to identify vulnerabilities before they are exploited.
- **Seamless integration**: Works with existing Solana, Ethereum, and Binance Smart Chain-based DApps without disrupting operations.
- **Scalability**: Designed to protect projects of all sizes, from small NFT platforms to large-scale DeFi protocols.

---

## üéØ **Key Features**

1. **On-Chain Protection**: 
    - Real-time monitoring of smart contract transactions.
    - Automated threat detection and mitigation.
    - Machine learning algorithms to flag suspicious behavior.
   
2. **Off-Chain Monitoring**:
    - Off-chain, our system continuously monitors the transaction ecosystem for unusual patterns or signs of fraud.
    - Any suspicious activities are flagged by our AI-driven threat detection algorithms.
    - DApp owners will receive instant alerts when suspicious activity is detected, allowing them to take action before a threat becomes reality.
    - This provides an additional layer of security, even outside of the blockchain.
    - Alerts and insights are sent to your user dashboard for full visibility.
     
3. **User-Friendly Dashboard**:
    - A centralized interface to monitor contract security.
    - Real-time alerts and reports to keep your project safe and informed.

## üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**

Sifu Security works in a dual-layer approach:

### **1. On-Chain Protection Flow**

![On Chain Flow](images/onchain_flow.png)


```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Frontend DApp
    participant SDK
    participant Backend
    participant Contract
    participant Simulation
    participant AI Model
    participant SIFU Verification
    
    Frontend DApp ->> SDK: Call SDK
    SDK ->> Backend: Send transaction data
    Backend ->> Contract: Fetch contract account states\nFetch contract IDL
    Contract ->> Simulation: Generate transaction simulation
    Simulation ->> AI Model: Send simulation data
    AI Model ->> SIFU Verification: Analyze for exploit
    SIFU Verification -->> AI Model: Valid/Invalid signature
    AI Model ->> Backend: Return signature
    Backend ->> Frontend DApp: Send signature
    Frontend DApp ->> Contract: Call transaction
    Contract ->> Backend: Verify signature
    alt Exploit detected
        Backend ->> Frontend DApp: Halt transaction (Invalid signature)
    else No exploit
        Backend ->> Frontend DApp: Proceed with the transaction (Valid signature)
    end
```

1. Smart contract transactions are integrated with our SDK and our Verification Contract.
2. SDK detects any malicious transactions and returns and invalid signature.
3. Transactions are halted on chain because of invalid signature due to AI detecting it's an exploit.

### **2. Off-Chain Monitoring Flow**

    B --> C[Threat Detection Algorithms]
    C --> D[Automated Mitigation]
    D --> E[Alerts to Dashboard]
```

1. Off-chain, our system continuously monitors the transaction ecosystem for unusual patterns or signs of fraud.
2. Any suspicious activities are flagged by our AI-driven threat detection algorithms.
3. DApp owners will receive instant alerts when suspicious activity is detected, allowing them to take action before a threat becomes reality.
4. This provides an additional layer of security, even outside of the blockchain.
5. Alerts and insights are sent to your user dashboard for full visibility.

## üìà **Usage**

To integrate Sifu Security into your project, follow the steps below:

### **Step 1: Install the Sifu Security Package**

```bash
npm install sifu-security
```

### **Step 2: Set Up On-Chain Monitoring**

Add the following snippet to your Solana contract to begin real-time monitoring:

```js
const SifuSecurity = require('sifu-security');

// Initialize monitoring
SifuSecurity.startMonitoring(contractAddress);
```

### **Step 3: Submit Contracts for Audit**

Submit your smart contracts for an off-chain audit:

```bash
sifu-security audit <contract_file.sol>
```

### **Step 4: Monitor via the Dashboard**

Visit [Sifu Security Dashboard](https://dashboard.sifusecurity.com) to access your project‚Äôs real-time security status and audit results.
